# id_extraction
This repo provides the template id, the script to train and some instructions.

For this script to work one needs to install the packages (pip) used in the script. Also, one needs the Google OCR engine (Tesseract) + the Python wrapper (pip install pytesseract).
I used the 4.0 version of the engine (since it supported the Dutch language) and downloaded the engine from https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/. This will install the engine (one might needs to adjust some directories in the script). The code provided is not clean (since it is was an evening project) but I can clarify things if one asks me.
Good luck!
